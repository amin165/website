<p>The br tag is similar to the ENTER key in function where the text goes on to the next line. The hr tag creates a horizontal line across the screen to simulate a break in the page</p>

Can't you see that it's just rainin’<br>
Ain't no need to go outside<br>
But baby<br>
You hardly even notice<br>
When I try to show you this<br>
Song is meant to keep you<br>
Doin' what you're supposed to<br>
Wakin' up too early<br>
Maybe we could sleep in<br>
Make you banana pancakes<br>
Pretend like its the weekend now<br>
We could pretend it all the time<br>
Can't you see that it's just rainin’<br>
There ain't no need to go outside<br>
